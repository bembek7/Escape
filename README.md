# Escape

Developed with Unreal Engine 5


A small parkour game where using abilities like dash or grapple you have to get through as many floors as you can. The faster you are the better. Slide, jump, run on the walls to get as fast as you can to the ond of the floor. Every floor is randomly generated from the array of possible rooms so you can play infinitely and every run will be different.


Right now I'm converting main classes from blueprints to c++, so the last playable version is in commit #3b1ab55. I was doing it all alone so there is no sound or animation. Some of the abilities are used from my another project ASCEND, but they're also made by me.
